# SensESP_3_Battery_Monitor
SensESP setup for monitoring 3 boat batteries

Hardware side
what I bought was:

- [Firebeetle 2 ESP32-E](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2231.html)

- [Buck converter](https://amzn.to/3Z54veM)

- [INA219 Current sensor boards](https://amzn.to/3EIlT1d)	

- [Waveshare CAN board](https://amzn.to/3Kud8ew)	

- [1-Wire Temperature sensors](https://amzn.to/3kkkZ3f)	

- [Ceramic Capacitors](https://amzn.to/3KjGs7s)	

- [Resistors](https://amzn.to/3IdH7VA)

- [500Âµohm Shunt](https://www.newark.com/vishay/wsms2908l5000jk/through-hole-current-sense-resistor/dp/27T3036?ost=wsms2908l5000jk)

I needed 3 Current Sensor Boards, so look carefully on the board you will see pads labelled A0 and A1 for battery A, I left the pads alone (default Address), for Battery B, I connected the A0 pad to the pad next to it (0x41) and for Battery C I connected A1 to the pad next to it (0x44)

Comprehensive documentation for SensESP, including how to get started with your own project, is available at the [SensESP documentation site](https://signalk.org/SensESP/).

See [Schematic.jpg](https://github.com/Techstyleuk/SensESP_3_Battery_Monitor/blob/main/Schematic.jpg) for the schematic and [INA219_detail.jpg](https://github.com/Techstyleuk/SensESP_3_Battery_Monitor/blob/main/INA219_detail.jpg) for more info on the current board setup

Here is a picture of the shunt on a test battery, the shunt was much smaller (physicallY) than I was expecting and I really need bigger holes, so a different one may make its way to the production version:
